### Hi there 👋
### Here's The Code I wrote. Adding music in the background was quite a task which I initially thought was easy. But it kinda showed me chukkalu coz it was working on the PC locally but when I was hosting it online it didn't work out :P. Found out a way in the end after a lot of research :P. I started doing this at 3 pm . Completed some parts till 6. Slept after that . Woke up after an hour tried fixing the music part :P didn't work out. Had dinner. Again Sat :P. This time it worked and then I texted you.  Through the build i hosted the webiste many times XD coz i initially thought that I was making a mistake in the code.Then I figured out that It was the browser that was shittin up. Ala ala. This website will always be available. Click on the link whenever you feel like watching it.
